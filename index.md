Initiating in the early 2000s, Human Sciences was first a transdisciplinary degree program designed by Professor Alf Hiltebeitel in Washington, DC. In 2015, Human Sciences operated as an alternative pedagogy program in Austin, TX. Now, Human Sciences is an international institute for explorations and interventions in research, education, and art. Our work is propelled by the question: What does it mean to be human? 

IHS builds upon, and diverges from, a twenty year effort in Open Science - opting for more judicious connections and intentionality in sharing information.
