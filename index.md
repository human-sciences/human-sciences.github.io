Initiating in the early 2000s, Human Sciences was first a transdisciplinary degree program designed by Professor Alf Hiltebeitel in Washington, DC. In 2015, Human Sciences operated as an alternative pedagogy program in Austin, TX. IHS builds upon, and diverges from, a twenty year effort in Open Science - opting for more judicious connections and intentionality in sharing information. Our research is organised around the question of what it means to be human.
