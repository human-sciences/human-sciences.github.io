What does it mean to be human?

As knowledge, creativity, and communication are increasingly rendered artificial; as our technology and institutions fail us, where can we still fi? We are a collective of scholars, artists, designers, developers, community organisers, and library workers setting a new vision for how we share information and enter into dialogue with one another.

Initiating in the early 2000s, Human Sciences was first a transdisciplinary degree program designed by Professor Alf Hiltebeitel in Washington, DC. In 2015, Human Sciences operated as an alternative pedagogy program in Austin, TX. IHS builds upon, and diverges from, a twenty year effort in Open Science - opting for more judicious connections and intentionality in sharing information.
